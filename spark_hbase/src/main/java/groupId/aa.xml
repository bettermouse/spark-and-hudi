        <description>A comma-separated list of BaseHFileCleanerDelegate invoked by
            the HFileCleaner service. These HFiles cleaners are called in order,
            so put the cleaner that prunes the most files in front. To
            implement your own BaseHFileCleanerDelegate, just put it in HBase's classpath
            and add the fully qualified class name here. Always add the above
            default hfile cleaners in the list as they will be overwritten in
            hbase-site.xml.</description>
